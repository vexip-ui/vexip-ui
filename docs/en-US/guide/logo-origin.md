Very grateful to [@RedBlues-1980](https://richuangangban1980.lofter.com/) for the design of this. He combined the imagery of the name Vexip to design this vivid and stereoscopic logo. I am very happy that it can become the logo of Vexip!

The works of [@RedBlues-1980](https://richuangangban1980.lofter.com/) are not only powerful and stereoscopic in appearance, but also fully consider the meaning and philosophy in the design, with rigorous logic, each work always makes people bright!

If you want to get such a great design, be sure to give him a try!
