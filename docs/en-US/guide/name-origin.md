# Why Call Vexip?

## Origin Of Name

You may wonder how the word Vexip seems to have no meaning, how did it come from?

That's really a very simple motive.

One day I tried to arrange some letters randomly on the paper, and found that V-e-x-i-p arranged five letters in this way looks very comfortable, and it was quite easy to write. See there also is natural pronunciation, so I decided to use it immediately!

Although this word is newly created and has no original meaning, we hope to give it the meaning of "pursuit of beauty", because it is beautiful in itself, and we also hope to try our best to pursue beauty in this project.
