# Drawer

Drawer is a great option when you want to make something fly in from the sides of the screen.

## Demos

:::demo drawer/basis

### Basis Usage

Simple usage, control the `active` prop through two-way binding to control the display of the drawer, and click the mask area to close the drawer.

:::

:::demo drawer/inner

### Inner Drawer

Adding the `inner` prop enables the drawer to be positioned according to the nearest element with the positioned attribute, thus implementing a inner drawer.

:::

:::demo drawer/nesting

### Nesting Usage

In the content slot of the drawer, a new drawer can be opened, which can solve the situation that the content needs to be multi-layered and multi-branched.

:::

:::demo drawer/position

### Custom Placement

Set the `placement` prop to `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` to customize the position of the drawer.

:::

:::demo drawer/long-content

### Long Content

Can be used in combination with scroll component when the content is too long.

:::

:::demo drawer/hide-mask

### Hide Mask

Add `hide-mask` prop to turn off the drawer's masking effect.

After turning off the mask effect, don't forget to provide other ways to turn it off.

:::

:::demo drawer/footer

### Add Footer

Add the `footer` prop to quickly add feet, or you can directly use the slot of the same name.

:::

:::demo drawer/resize

### Resizable

Add the `resizable` prop to enable resizing of the drawer.

Move the mouse to the edge of the drawer and a handle will appear. The width of the drawer in the left and right directions can be adjusted, and the height of the drawer in the up and down direction can be adjusted.
