# Upload

The upload control is used to upload some files to the remote server through the web page, which can provide friendly interaction and complete information display.

## Demos

:::demo upload/basis

### Basis Usage

Use `url` prop to set the upload destination address, which will be automatically uploaded after selecting a file. By default is single file upload.

:::

:::demo upload/drag

### Drop Upload

Add the `allow-drag` prop to enable drag and drop upload mode.

:::

:::demo upload/default-files

### Default Files

The `default-files` prop allows you to set static default files that will not be processed on upload.

:::

:::demo upload/list-type

### List Type

The file list type can be set via the `list-type` prop.

:::

:::demo upload/manual

### Manual Upload

When the `url` prop is not set, the internal `execute` method will be blocked and the file needs to be uploaded manually.

It is also possible to explicitly set the `manual` prop to enable manual upload mode.

:::

:::demo upload/image

### Image Mode

Adding the `image` prop to enable image upload mode, after which the `accept` and `list-type` props will be invalid.

:::

:::demo upload/select-to-add

### Select To Add

By default the file list will reset when re-select.

If you want to append those selected files to the file list, you can add the `select-to-add` prop.

:::

:::demo upload/separation

### List Separation

Add the `hidden-files` prop to disable the internal file listing display.

And you can achieve the effect of a separate file list with the UploadList component. Of course you can write it by yourself.

:::

:::demo upload/multiple

### Multiple Upload

Adding the `multiple` prop to enable multiple files upload.

:::

:::demo upload/directory

### Directory Upload

Add the `directory` prop to enable folder upload mode.

When using the click-to-upload interaction, only folders can be uploaded due to browser limitations.

Note that this feature only works in browsers that support `webkitdirectory`.
