# Spin

Enable fast switching of the loading state for a block.

It is often used in situations where data rendering or asynchronous processing takes a long time to avoid users being unable to obtain effective feedback for a long time.

## Demos

:::demo spin/basis

### Basis Usage

In the simplest usage, control the loading state via the `active` prop.

:::

:::demo spin/delay

### Delay Switch

Control the delay time for loading state changes by setting the `delay` prop.

When `true` is passed in, `500ms` delay of showing and disappearing will be enabled by default, and the number of milliseconds can be controlled by passing in a number.

When you want to obtain different delay durations for display and disappearance, you can pass in an array containing two numbers for separate control.

:::demo spin/directive

### Directive

Use the `v-loading` directive to quickly add a loading state to an element.

When it is inconvenient to modify the root element of the parent component and does not require a high degree of customization, the use of directives can effectively reduce the complexity of the code.

:::demo spin/inner

### Inner Spin

Inner mode can be enabled by setting the `inner` prop.

It is often used in situations where it is inconvenient to modify the root element of the parent component and a certain degree of customization is required.
