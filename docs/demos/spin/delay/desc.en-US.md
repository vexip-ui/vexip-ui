### Delay Switch

Control the delay time for loading state changes by setting the `delay` prop.

When `true` is passed in, `500ms` delay of showing and disappearing will be enabled by default, and the number of milliseconds can be controlled by passing in a number.

When you want to obtain different delay durations for display and disappearance, you can pass in an array containing two numbers for separate control.
