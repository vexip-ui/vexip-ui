### Toast Types

The toast with preset type can be opened by calling different methods.

There are currently four built-in preset types in the component, which are opened by calling `success`, `warning`, `error` and `loading` respectively.

The `loading` method contains an invisible mask by default, which blocks the interaction of the page.
