### Filter Data

Adding the `filter` prop to the column options and setting it enables filtering.

If you want to only the filter events will be emitted (e.g. remote filter), you can add `custom-filter` prop to Table component.

Also you can custom the renderer of filter via `filter` slot of TableColumn component.
