    Vexip UI
  </H1>
  <P>
    Vexip UI provides a series of out-of-the-box components. Almost all the
    <Strong> default value of props </Strong>
    for each component can be quickly modified by configuration (except value and options props),
    for easy customization. And, the writing of component codes pay great attention to lowering the
    threshold of
    <Strong> source codes reading </Strong>
    , and the style of code is as close to the usual business code habits as possible to avoid
    dazzling encapsulation.
