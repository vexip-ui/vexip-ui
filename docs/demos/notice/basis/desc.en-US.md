### Basis Usage

Open a text-only prompt with the `open` method.

This method can receive a string or object, which will be used as the prompt content when passed in. The passed object can control the prompt attribute in a finer-grained manner. For specific optional attributes, please refer to the api description.

Depending on the presence or absence of the `title` and `content` options, the component will be rendered into a triple state of normal, title only, and content only.
